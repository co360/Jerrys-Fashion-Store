# JERRY'S FASHION e-STORE WEB APPLICATION

## Quick Start

### Running on local environment.
1. First, apply a personal firebase, stripe account.
2. Enter below cmd:
#### `nodemon`
If you want to modify the client side parts, please enter the client
and enter below cmd:
#### `npm start`.

3. Back-end part:
   We use Express.js to build the back-end. 

4. GraphQL part:
   Due to the system-design issues, we have to build unique server for GraphQL server--- as you may know, the most powerful part of GraphQL is to use it as a middleware and fetch data from different datasource! (e.g. mySQL, Oracle,local storage...)

### Deployment
This application is now deployed on Google Cloud Platform.
If you ask me why is it not AWS...
The answer is simple : GCP IS FREE FOR A YEAR.
And guess what ? I have NO MONEY.
